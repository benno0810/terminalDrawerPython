1. please notice the insert mode and color change mode will only enable one insertion/one vertex color change each time.
(i.e enter "i" and click trible times to form a triangle, then enter insertion again if want to add more triangles)
(enter 'c' and click to choose the nearest vertex, change color then click 'c' again if you want to select then change color.)

2. use '=' to scale up after selection instead of '+' because '+'doesn;t work.

3. USE 'e' to exit all the mode and reset the shaders to default.

mainly do the test in windows+visual studio 2022 but can also make throught ubuntu with g++11.2 with custurmized CMakeList.

If there are any not compatiible bug please let me know. And be aware that the virtual machine is sometimes acting wierd with the keyboard mapping so some bug do happened sometimes.
